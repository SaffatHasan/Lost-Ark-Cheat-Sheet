# Aira's Oculus

## Boss 1 - Frenzied Cicerra

- Increases damage per stagger. 3 stacks = oneshot
- Purple field decreases stagger and increases damage taken
    - Take for high-stagger classes (e.g. berserker, gunlancer)
- Cardinal Flail Strike
    - Attacks in 4 cardinal direction swing -> medium aoe in front
    - Every OTHER time he will grab player in front
    - Getting grabbed -> stagger removes 1 increasing damage stack (can prevent 3 stacks)

## Boss 2 - Lost Seto

- Slow walk -> ball spawn (avoid)
- Vertical jump onto ball -> spread out
- Hula-hoop -> dodge
- Center teleport (10 or 11 bars) -> spread out and destroy balls
- DDR attack -> sequence on screen and run

### Phase 3

- 1 Player not frozen -> must free others to dodge AOE
- Repeat but vice versa
